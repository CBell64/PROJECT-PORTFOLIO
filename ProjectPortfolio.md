**Report's Design:**

An online electronic store specializing in computers can benefit from various reports to track sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory levels. Here's a list of potential reports: 

Sales Reports 

Sales by Product: This report shows the quantity and total revenue generated from individual computer products or categories (laptops, desktops, tablets, gaming accessories, Android and iphone) over a chosen period. 

Sales by Brand: This report analyzes sale performance for different computer brands stocked in the store, identifying top-selling brands and potential areas for improvement. 

Sales by Price Range: This report segments sales data by product price range, providing insights into customer spending habits and price sensitivity. 

Sales by Customer: This report details individual customer purchase history, revealing buying trends and opportunities for targeted promotions or loyalty programs. 

Sales by Region/Location: This report analyzes sales performance in different geographic locations (if applicable), helping identify areas with high demand or requiring additional marketing efforts. 

Sales Performance Over Time: This report tracks sales trends over a specific period (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly), allowing for analysis of seasonal fluctuations or the impact of marketing campaigns. 

Inventory Reports 

Inventory Levels: This report provides a real-time overview of current stock levels for various computer products, helping with stock management and preventing stockouts. 

Low Stock Alert Report: This report identifies products with low inventory levels, prompting timely reordering to maintain stock availability. 

Inventory Movement Report: This report tracks the inflow and outflow of computer products within the store, providing insights into product demand and stock turnover. 

Customer Reports 

Customer Acquisition Report: This report analyzes how customers find the online store, identifying the effectiveness of marketing channels and potential areas for improvement. 

Customer Demographics Report: This report provides insights into customer demographics (age, location, gender), allowing for targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations. 

Customer Purchase History Report: This report details individual customer purchase history, revealing buying trends and opportunities for targeted promotions or loyalty programs. 

Customer Reviews Report: This report analyzes customer reviews of products, providing valuable feedback for product selection and improvement. 

Additional Reports 

Website Traffic Report: This report tracks website traffic, user behavior (e.g., page views, time spent on specific pages), and identifies areas for improvement in website design and user experience. 

Marketing Campaign Performance Report: This report analyzes the effectiveness of marketing campaigns in driving traffic and sales, allowing for optimization of marketing strategies. 

Abandoned Cart Report: This report identifies instances where customers added products to their cart but did not complete the purchase. Analyzing the reasons behind abandoned carts can help improve checkout processes and increase conversion rates. 

By generating and analyzing these reports regularly, the online electronic store can gain valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory management. This data can then be used to optimize operations, improve customer experience, and make data-driven decisions for business growth.
