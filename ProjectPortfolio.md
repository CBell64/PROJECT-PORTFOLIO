Track product inventory levels.
User Accounts:
User registration and login functionalities with secure password hashing.
User profile management with address information (optional).
Order history and tracking (optional).
Product Browsing and Search:
Intuitive interface for browsing products by category, brand, or price range.
Powerful search functionality using keywords and filtering options.
Shopping Cart and Checkout:
Allow users to add and remove products from a virtual shopping cart.
Update cart quantities and manage product selections.
Secure checkout process with encrypted payment gateway integration.
Support for various payment methods (e.g., credit cards, debit cards, PayPal).
Order Management:
Process and manage customer orders efficiently.
Track order status and provide updates to customers.
Order confirmation emails with details and estimated delivery timeframe (optional).
Technical Stack:

**Non Functional Requirements/Front-End:**

Consider using a popular JavaScript framework like ReactJS, Vue.js, or Angular for a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
Back-End:
Spring Boot for server-side development, providing features like automatic configuration, dependency injection, and embedded servers.
Database:
Utilize a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB to store product data, user information, and orders.
Security:
Implement Spring Security for user authentication, authorization, and API security.
Secure password hashing using one-way cryptographic functions.
Secure data storage through encryption (optional).
Consider integrating HTTPS for encrypted communication between client and server.
Payment Processing:
Integrate with a secure payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal to handle online transactions securely.
Additional Considerations:

Deployment: Choose a suitable deployment strategy based on your needs, such as cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud Platform) or on-premise servers.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring tools to track application health and performance. Utilize logging frameworks to record application events for easier troubleshooting.
Testing: Integrate automated testing tools (e.g., JUnit, Spring Integration Test) to ensure code quality, functionality, and regression prevention.
Documentation: Create comprehensive user documentation and API references for smooth user experience and developer understanding.
Future Enhancements (Optional):

Implement a wish list functionality.
Integrate with a review and rating system for products.
Offer personalized product recommendations based on user purchase history.
Develop a mobile application for on-the-go shopping.
This portfolio provides a high-level overview of the online electronic store project. You can customize it further by including:

Screenshots or mockups to showcase the user interface.
Specific code examples to demonstrate technical implementations.
Performance metrics (if applicable) to highlight the application's efficiency.
Deployment details if the project is deployed to a production environment.
By showcasing your work in this way, you can effectively demonstrate your skills and experience in building a Spring Boot application for an online electronic store.

**Core Technologies used to build an online electronic store with Spring Boot:**

Front-End Development:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Frameworks (Optional):
ReactJS, Vue.js, or Angular: These frameworks provide structure, reusable components, and improve code maintainability for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
UI Component Libraries (Optional):
Material-UI or Bootstrap: These libraries offer pre-built components and styles to accelerate development and ensure a consistent user experience.
Back-End Development (Spring Boot):

Java: Spring Boot applications are primarily written in Java.
Spring Boot: A framework that simplifies building production-ready backend applications. It provides features like:
Automatic configuration
Dependency injection
Embedded servers (optional)
Spring Data JPA (Optional): Simplifies interaction with relational databases using JPA (Java Persistence API).
Database:

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): These databases store structured data efficiently. Popular choices include:
MySQL
PostgreSQL
MariaDB
Security:

Spring Security: A framework for implementing user authentication, authorization, and API security. It helps with:
Secure password hashing
Secure session management
Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
HTTPS: Encrypts communication between the user's browser and the server, protecting sensitive data like login credentials.
Payment Processing (Optional):

Payment Gateway: Integration with a secure payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal allows for secure online transactions.
Additional Considerations:

Version Control System (VCS): Using Git for version control allows for collaborative development and tracking changes in the codebase.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD automate building, testing, and deploying the application.
API Documentation: Tools like Swagger can be used to document APIs for easier integration and understanding.
Testing Frameworks: JUnit for unit testing and Spring Integration Test for integration testing ensure code quality and application functionality.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring tools to track application health and performance. Utilize logging frameworks to record application events for easier troubleshooting.
